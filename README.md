## Key Features

* Multiple documents types can be processed
  * This sample can is setup to prcoess invoices and recipts using the prebuilt Azure Azure Document Intelligence models.
* Fraud summary Generated by Azure Open AI
  * Each application is summarised by Azure Open AI to dected potential fraud.
* Information stored in Cosmos DB
  * All information is stored in Cosmos DB for later retrieval.
* Includes two prebuilt frontends
  * Gradio has been used to create two front ends to interact with the process. One to submit the application and one to view the results.
* Azure Functions
  * The process is run as an Azure Functions (Platform as a Service) so there is no admin overhead.

## Pre-req Azure components

This repo has the code for all three functions used in this process, but there are some pre-req components that need to be created in Azure before you can deploy the code.

* Cosmos DB
  * Create a Cosmos DB account with a SQL API
  * Create a database called "ToDoList"
  * Create a container called "docs"
  * Create a container called "leases"
* Azure Blob Storage
  * Create a Blob Storage account
  * Create a container called "invoice"
  * Create a container called "receipt"
  * Create a container called "processed"
* Azure AI Document Intelligence
  * Create a Document Intelligence resource
* Azure Open AI
  * Create an Open AI resource
  * Create a deployment that uses GPT-4 called "gpt-4"
* Azure Functions
  * Create an Azure Functions app
  * Deploy the python function code to the Azure Functions app
  * this should create 3 functions; invoice, receipt and fraud

## How To Use

To clone and run this application, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) installed on your computer.

```bash
# 1. Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/fredderf204/doc-intel-fraud

# 2. Go into the repository
$ cd doc-intel-fraud

# If you would like to test the functions locally first, deploy all of the pre-req Azure Components, except for the three Azure Functions. Then skip to number 4.
# 3. Deploy the pre-req Azure Components (More Options coming shortly) 

# If you would like to test the functions locally first, you can run the following commands to install the dependencies and run the functions locally with either option 4a or 4b.
# 4a. Run the Function code locally, using Azure Functions Core Tools (More Options coming shortly)
$ cd functions
$ python3 -m venv .venv
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ func start

# 4b. Run the Function code locally, using VS Code (More Options coming shortly)
$ cd functions
$ python3 -m venv .venv
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
click on function_app.py
click on the debug icon.

# 4c. Deploy the Function code to Azure, using Azure Functions Core Tools (More Options coming shortly) 
$ func azure functionapp publish <functionappname>

# 5. Run the Gradio application front end
$ cd gradio
$ python3 -m venv .venv
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
click on client-demo-multi.py
click on the debug icon

# 6. Run the Gradio application processor front end
click on processor-demo.py
click on the debug icon
```
